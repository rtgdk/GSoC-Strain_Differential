Sequence 1

A C G T G G

Sequence 2

A T C G T G A

Sequence 3

A C G C C T G G

Or, in a multiple alignment format

A   C G     T G G
A T C G     T G A
A   C G C C T G G

If A is the reference, B has an insertion after position 1 and a SNP at position 6
If B is the reference, A has a deletion at positon 2 and a SNP at position 7
Against the multiple alignment, A has a deletion at positon 2, another deletion at positons 5-6, and a SNP (wrt B, but not wrt C) at position 9.
